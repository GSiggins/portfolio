            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in California I spent my childhood enjoying the California sun, swimming during the sweltering summer days, 
                and riding my bike until the streetlights turned on. Fast forward to highschool, where a love for photography and graphic design was born, 
                I found myself pursuing photography through college.  A chance exposure to Emergency Medical Services ingited a fire for helping others that 
                led down a path to paramedicine, working in 911, as well as providing medical services to local law enforcement agencies.  </p>
